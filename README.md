## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project
Update: Dabney has optimized this portfolio.  The optimized code can be found in the 'build' directory.  The optimized code is also hosted on Github Pages and can be run here: http://dabney.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-mobile-portfolio/build/
Here are some things I did to optimize:

1) Used Photoshop and gulp-webp to optimize images and size them appropriately

2) Inlined style sheets to eliminate loading external stylesheet file

3) Hotlinked font family and only used latin characters for faster loading

4) Added media="print" to the loading of the print stylesheet to eliminate blocking for screen rendering

5) Moved analytics loading to end to keep from blocking

6) Minified the Javascript using gulp-uglify

7) In main.js for pizza page optimized wherever I could including:

    -moved all the naming arrays outside of switch statement so they would be defined once and then reused
    
    -moved variable declaration for i out of loops so it can be reused
    
    -added global variable so querySelector on #pizzaSize is not called repeatedly
    
    -added pizzaMoverItems as a global variable so it does not need to be called repeatedly
    
    -used style.transform instead of style.left
    
    -moved variable declarations/assignments outside of loops wherever possible
    
    

Your challenge, if you wish to accept it (and we sure hope you will), is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques you've picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

To get started, check out the repository, inspect the code,

### Getting started

Some useful tips to help you get started:

1. Check out the repository
1. To inspect the site on your phone, you can run a local server

  ```bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080 --> c:\Python34\python -m http.server 8080
  ```

1. Open a browser and visit localhost:8080
1. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to make your local server accessible remotely.

  ``` bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> ngrok 8080 --> C:\Users\chriss\Documents\ngrok\ngrok 8080
  ```

1. Copy the public URL ngrok gives you and try running it through PageSpeed Insights! [More on integrating ngrok, Grunt and PageSpeed.](http://www.jamescryer.com/2014/06/12/grunt-pagespeed-and-ngrok-locally-testing/)

Profile, optimize, measure... and then lather, rinse, and repeat. Good luck!

### Customization with Bootstrap
The portfolio was built on Twitter's <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> framework. All custom styles are in `dist/css/portfolio.css` in the portfolio repo.
